The examples folder contains a wide range of examples that demonstrate the capabilities of ValEnsPy. 

The basics_notebook.ipynb are non-valenspy specific examples to get used to some functionalities used in valenspy.

To get to know the valenspy workflow we recommend the following notebooks for the different steps:
- Load the data (see [input_manager notebook](input_manager.ipynb))
- Preprocess the data - see
    - [regridding](processing_regridding.ipynb)
- Run the diagnostics

For other functionalities see the following notebooks:
- How the cf convention is used in valenspy (see [cf_ccheker notebook](other_cf_checker.ipynb))

The Integrated_examples folder contains real-world examples of how ValEnsPy has been used to do simple and complex analyses.
